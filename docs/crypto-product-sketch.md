_donate cryptocurrency to a portfolio of charities chosen by you and your trusted friends_

## Overview

"Causes" can be things like "Climate Change" or "Gender Equality." 

"Charities" are actual organizations which can accept donations. Charities are tagged with causes for which they contribute to. 

As a user, I can set the % of my donations which go towards each cause. For example, I could choose 100% of my donations go towards Climate Change or I could choose 50%/50% go towards Human Rights and Gender Equality. 

For each cause, I can set %s for where my donations go. Donations can go to my chosen charities AND/OR my friends recommendations. 

For example, if I saved the charity "The Water Project" which is tagged with the cause "Human Rights", then I will have the option to set a % of my donations towards "Human Rights" go to "The Water Project." I may also set the % of my donations which go to "Human Rights" go to Nikola Radoicic's recommendations. Donations sent to Nikola for Human Rights will go towards his allocation for Human Rights, be that various charities, his friends or a combination thereof. Likewise, donations going to "Human Rights" requesting my reccomdation will follow my allocation.
